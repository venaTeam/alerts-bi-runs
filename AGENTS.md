## alerts-bi-runs: agent navigation

Analysis execution, HTTP trigger, weekly scheduling, SQL persistence and migrations; producer of shared and operations libraries.

### Sources of authority

- design: `docs/upstream/alerts_bi_design.md` — Read in full before all repository work.
- design: `docs/upstream/alerts_bi_flow.md` — Approved runtime flow.
- design: `docs/upstream/alerts_bi_implementation_plan.md` — Implementation blueprint.
- design: `docs/upstream/outputs.md` — Output and API meanings.

### Verification

- unit: `["uv", "run", "pytest", "tests/unit", "-q"]` in `.` (observed; pyproject.toml; executed results recorded in design/releases/).
- lint: `["uv", "run", "ruff", "check", "."]` in `.` (observed; pyproject.toml; executed results recorded in design/releases/).
- format: `["uv", "run", "ruff", "format", "--check", "."]` in `.` (observed; pyproject.toml; executed results recorded in design/releases/).
- types: `["uv", "run", "mypy"]` in `.` (observed; pyproject.toml; executed results recorded in design/releases/).

### Project invariants

- Before answering a repository question or doing repository work, read the canonical design in full. Read the runtime flow and implementation blueprint in full for architecture, implementation or integration. If the design cannot be read, stop and report the blocker.
- Design > approved flow > implementation blueprint > code. Read outputs.md before changing exports, report rendering or API contracts. Read both alerting guides completely for rule, scoring, prompt or alert-quality work.
- Use the pinned docs/upstream snapshot when this repository is cloned alone. It is an immutable input: propose product changes in alerts-bi-design and refresh the recorded revision/hashes. Do not silently edit snapshots or reinterpret approved behavior.
- If a parent AGENTS.md exists in a multi-repository workspace, read it explicitly for routing. The repository remains buildable and understandable without it. Parent instructions never become a runtime dependency.
- Inspect local changes before edits, preserve others work, and keep KeepHQ excluded. Do not install GitHub or Figma plugins. Use the selected main model.
- Use Python 3.12+, committed uv.lock, pytest, ruff and strict mypy. SQLAlchemy Core with pymssql targets real SQL Server; never SQLite or an in-memory integration substitute. No Node.js build/test dependency.
- Keep one selected team per run, app+key identity, exact UTC windows, separate v1/v2 counts and SQL-only output rendering. Preserve R6 episode boundaries, suppression safety, LLM audit/retry behavior, prompt text, and deterministic identifiers.
- Do not edit applied SQL/revision files or regenerate the hand-authored expected-results oracle. Runs owns the sole migration chain. Changes to immutable prompt/catalog/instant formats require their approved version process.
- No secrets, alert documents or complete model payloads in normal logs or commits. Use environment settings and placeholders. Read deployment credentials only for the authorized task.
- Use eng-coordinate for cross-repository work and establish contracts before parallel implementation. At most three useful children, no recursive delegation, bounded ownership, one integrator. Subagents read the complete design and report files, commands, assumptions and actual results.
- Run the affected checks and coordinated contracts; report missing services and skipped checks honestly. Reset only the explicit local mock and disposable alerts_bi_test database. Never delete development or production data. Deployment, merges and external messaging need existing authorization.
- AGENTS.md is the only instruction body; CLAUDE.md stays a short @AGENTS.md pointer. Record accepted product decisions in canonical design in the same task, with a date, and reconcile affected flow/contracts.
- Own the only migration tree and original mock fixture generator. Preserve migration/revision bytes through the src.db.ledger compatibility shim. Keep shared free of application/operator imports; operations depends only on shared, never apps. Publish a new immutable library version when shared contents change.

Use this project guidance with more specific area instructions. Requirements and decisions remain in their linked sources.
Preserve local changes; use the narrowest meaningful checks and report what actually ran. Setup does not grant deployment authority.
