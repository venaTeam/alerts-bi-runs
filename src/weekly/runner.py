"""Running and publishing the weeks that are due (design section 7.11).

``alerts-bi weekly`` calls :func:`run_weekly`. It is safe to invoke as often as the
scheduler likes - the OpenShift CronJob runs it daily - because a week that is already
published is never due again. Running daily rather than weekly is what makes a missed
invocation self-healing.

For every team enrolled with ``weekly_review.enabled``, one at a time:

1. Plan the due weeks (:func:`alerts_bi_runs.weekly.plan.plan_weeks`).
2. Run each due week oldest first, as an ordinary single-team run, and persist it. Every due
   week is run and stored even when it cannot be published yet, so no week is lost to
   Elasticsearch retention while an earlier one waits for a person.
3. Publish a week automatically only when it is healthy - the model assessed every alert it
   was asked about - and only while every earlier due week was published. An unhealthy week
   is **held** and retried on every invocation; healthy weeks after it are **stored** until it
   is resolved. A week still unhealthy :data:`HOLD_DAYS` days after it was first held is
   published anyway, with a reader note saying how many alerts were not assessed - the
   portal already shows those as "Not reviewed", so nothing is passed off as examined.

A failure for one team is recorded and never stops the others. Every outcome is appended to
``weekly_review_log``. Two schedulers can never overlap: the whole invocation holds a SQL
Server application lock.
