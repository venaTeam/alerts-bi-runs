"""Team-scoped Elasticsearch retrieval (design section 6; flow step 2).

Two separate queries, each restricted to the selected team's configured operators and to
the exact run window. The queries do not restrict ``application``, do not apply the team's
own panel filters, do not read the SQL hot table, and never sweep another team's alerts.

Elasticsearch row ids are read but never persisted as business identity: source documents
expire after three months, so an id is not a durable reference.
