"""Request payload construction (design section 5.1; flow step 6.2).

The payload factors out only what the batch demonstrably shares. Grouping by
``alert_rule_url`` or ``application`` does NOT prove that ``component``, ``severity``,
``provider``, ``impact`` or ``runbook_url`` are identical, so a field moves into the group
header only when its value is equal across every alert in that batch.

This is lossless: every full document is reconstructable from header plus row. It is the
same content sent once instead of repeatedly, not an extraction that withholds context
from the model.
