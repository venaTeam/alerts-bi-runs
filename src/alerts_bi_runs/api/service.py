"""Everything the surface does to the pipeline.

The routes are transport: they parse, negotiate and format. This module is where the
surface actually touches the pipeline, and it is deliberately thin - it calls the same
``execute_run`` and ``persist_run`` the command line calls, and renders through the same
``build_run_outputs``. There is no second code path that could drift from the CLI.
