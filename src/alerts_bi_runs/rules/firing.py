"""R6: one alert's firing episodes (design 7.14).

Grafana writes one Elasticsearch row on every evaluation and its repeat interval is
disabled, so a still-firing Grafana alert keeps producing rows. A Grafana row count therefore
reflects evaluation frequency, and R6 never judges row counts for Grafana alerts. Episodes,
meaning clear transitions, carry the meaning.

An *episode* is a maximal run of consecutive firing (non-clear) rows, ordered by
``(timestamp, is_clear, doc_hash)``; a clear row closes it, and a clear sharing an instant
with a firing row sorts after it. The firing rows after the last clear form the *open
episode*.

Stuck measures the open episode as its rows show it: from ``open_since`` to the last firing
row, never to the window's end. Grafana writes a row on every evaluation while an alert
fires, so silence after the last row means the alert is no longer firing (it resolved, or
the rule was deleted or paused), not that it is stuck. One row spans zero and is never
stuck. An alert that started firing before the window still writes rows throughout it, so
its open episode starts at its first in-window row and stuck reads "the open episode's
firing rows span at least 72h of the window".

Spamming applies to non-Grafana (API) alerts only; stuck to Grafana alerts only.
