"""Rule execution grain and aggregation (design section 4; flow step 4).

Core rules are evaluated on EVERY raw row, then aggregated to alert identity:

- ``count`` per rule is the number of rows that actually match.
- ``distinct_count`` per rule is the number of identities with at least one matching row.
- Findings stay attached only to the rows that matched. They are never projected onto
  other rows sharing an identity, because that would move a finding onto a date where
  nothing was wrong.

LLM eligibility is decided at IDENTITY level after that row-level pass: any core finding
anywhere in the window withholds the whole identity. That deliberately accepts losing a
second, advisory judgment for the alert - a deterministic finding already gives the team a
concrete fix, whereas evaluating only the representative could miss a row-specific R5
suppression or R7 timestamp failure.
