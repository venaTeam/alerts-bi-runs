"""Alembic environment.

The database URL is never written here: it is built from the same configuration the
application uses, so there is one place that knows how to reach SQL Server. Which database
to migrate is passed in by the caller through ``config.attributes["database"]``.

Offline mode is deliberately unsupported. Every migration runs its DDL through the driver
and records a checksum in the ledger, and neither is expressible as emitted SQL text.
