"""Migration runner, over Alembic.

Alembic owns ordering. Its revision graph is what makes two migrations added concurrently
collide as multiple heads rather than both applying in filename order and leaving the two
databases that ran them subtly different.

Alembic does not own content: ``alembic_version`` holds a single row naming the current
head, so an edit to an already-applied revision is invisible to it. The checksum ledger in
:mod:`alerts_bi_runs.db.ledger` covers that, and is verified before every upgrade.

Tests do not substitute SQLite or another engine, because a constraint that only exists in
one dialect is a constraint that was never tested.
